# Rails Blog 

This is the source code repository for my Rails Blog.

Before all you need to install imagemagick from here:
https://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows

Before run, write this to command line:

bundle exec rake webpacker:install


If you got an error called "PendingMigrationError" just click "Run pending migrations"
